Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of LoanOptimizer Project
Introduction and Context
Loan portfolio optimization is a vital process for financial institutions and investors, involving the allocation of capital across different loan types to maximize returns while managing risks. This is particularly crucial in a dynamic financial environment where factors like interest rates, default probabilities, and regulatory requirements can fluctuate. The LoanOptimizer project, as outlined, aims to develop a web-based application to address these needs, targeting both financial institutions (e.g., banks, credit unions, peer-to-peer lending platforms) and individual users (e.g., investors, financial advisors). The objective is to enable efficient capital allocation, maximize expected returns, manage risk, and provide predictive and inferential insights for decision-making.

The project is set for a 20-day timeline, adjustable as needed, with a team of 5 members, and the final deliverable is a fully functional, deployed web application accessible via a public URL. This includes user authentication, input flexibility, optimization capabilities, analytics, visualizations, and export features.

Key Concepts and Definitions
To ensure clarity, let's break down the core concepts:

Capital Budget: This refers to the total amount of money available for lending. For instance, if a bank has $10 million, this is the maximum they can distribute across loan types.
Loan Types and Characteristics: Different loans have unique profiles:
Mortgages: Secured by real estate, typically with lower interest rates (e.g., 4%) and lower default probabilities (e.g., 1%), making them low-risk.
Personal Loans: Unsecured, with higher interest rates (e.g., 12%) and default probabilities (e.g., 5%), indicating higher risk.
Auto Loans: Secured by vehicles, with moderate rates (e.g., 8%) and default probabilities (e.g., 3%).
Small Business Loans: Varying risk, with higher rates (e.g., 15%) and default probabilities (e.g., 8%).
Credit Card Loans: High interest rates (e.g., 18%) but high default rates (e.g., 10%), reflecting significant risk.
Interest Rate: The percentage charged on the loan, affecting returns.
Default Probability: The likelihood of a borrower failing to repay, a key risk measure.
Loss Given Default (LGD): The percentage of the loan lost if default occurs, e.g., 50% LGD means recovering half the amount.
Expected Return: Calculated as

 , accounting for both interest and potential losses.
Risk Measures: Include variance (volatility of returns), standard deviation, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), which focuses on worst-case losses (e.g., 95% CVaR of 5% means average loss in worst 5% scenarios is 5%).
Correlation Between Loan Types: Measures how defaults of different loans move together; high correlation increases portfolio risk, as defaults in one type may trigger others.
These concepts form the foundation for the optimization model, ensuring the app can handle diverse loan portfolios effectively.

Optimization Model and Technical Details

User Personas and Use Cases
The app targets diverse users, with personas like:

Sara, Bank Loan Manager: Works at a regional bank with a $50M portfolio, limited technical expertise, uses Excel, seeks to meet regulatory requirements while maximizing returns, struggles with complex models, needs clear explanations.
Michael, Individual Investor: Retired finance professional investing in peer-to-peer lending, moderate expertise, wants to diversify, understand risks, lacks tools for analysis.
Jessica, Financial Advisor: Advises high-net-worth clients, high expertise, needs evidence-based recommendations, must explain concepts simply to clients.
An example use case for Sara:

Capital Budget: $10 million
Loan Types: Mortgages (4% interest, 1% default), Personal Loans (12%, 5%), Auto Loans (8%, 3%), Small Business Loans (15%, 8%), Credit Card Loans (18%, 10%)
Risk Tolerance: Moderate (variance ≤ 0.002)
Regulatory Requirement: At least 20% in low-risk loans (mortgages, auto loans)
Recommendation:

Mortgages: $2M (20%), Auto Loans: $2.5M (25%), Personal Loans: $1.5M (15%), Small Business Loans: $2.5M (25%), Credit Card Loans: $1.5M (15%)
Expected Return: 6.5%, Risk (Std. Dev.): 4.2%
What-If Scenario: If default probabilities increase by 50% (e.g., economic downturn), expected return drops to 5.1%, with more allocation to low-risk loans like mortgages and auto loans.

Development Phases and Timeline
The project follows a phased approach over 20 days:

Phase 1 (Days 1-7): Core optimization engine, mathematical model, CVXPY implementation, basic data input, and output display.
Phase 2 (Days 8-12): Basic web interface, user authentication, intuitive forms, visualizations, export functionality.
Phase 3 (Days 13-17): Advanced analytics, what-if scenarios, sensitivity analysis, enhanced visualizations, user experience improvements.
Phase 4 (Days 18-20): Final testing, performance optimization, cloud deployment on Heroku, documentation, and presentation.
This timeline ensures a structured approach, with milestones like completing the model definition by Week 1 and deploying by the final days.

Test Cases for Development
To ensure robustness, test cases include:

Basic Optimization Test: Input default dataset, $10M budget, default constraints, expect optimal allocation, returns, risk metrics.
Constraint Testing: Add constraint (e.g., 40% in low-risk loans), expect new allocation meeting constraint, likely lower return.
What-If Scenario Test: Increase default probabilities by 50%, expect updated allocation, reduced return.
Edge Case - High Risk Tolerance: Very high risk tolerance (variance ≤ 0.01), expect aggressive allocation to high-return loans.
Edge Case - Low Budget: $100,000 budget, expect valid scaled results.
These tests ensure the app handles various scenarios, enhancing reliability.
