# LoanOptimizer: A Product-Based Web Application for Loan Portfolio Optimization

## Project Overview

**Title:** Loan Portfolio Optimization for Risk and Return
**Product Name:** LoanOptimizer

**Objective:** Develop a product-based web application that enables financial institutions (e.g., banks, credit unions, peer-to-peer lending platforms) and individual users (e.g., investors, financial advisors) to optimize loan portfolio allocations, maximize expected returns, manage risk, and gain predictive and inferential insights for decision-making.

**Target Users:** Firms (e.g., banks, lending platforms) and individuals (e.g., investors, loan officers) seeking to allocate capital across loan types efficiently.
**Timeline:** 20 days (adjustable as needed)
**Team Size:** 5 members
**Final Deliverable:** A fully functional, deployed web application accessible via a public URL, with user authentication, input flexibility, optimization, analytics, visualizations, and export features.

## Detailed Problem Statement and Explanation

### Basic Concepts Explained

**Capital Budget:** This refers to the total amount of money that a bank, financial institution, or investor has available to lend out to borrowers. For example, if a bank has $10 million as their capital budget, this is the total amount they can distribute across different types of loans.

**Money Lending:** This is the core business of financial institutions. They provide loans to individuals or businesses who need money, and in return, they earn interest on these loans. Different types of loans have different interest rates and risks.

**Mortgages:** These are specific types of loans used to purchase property or real estate. The property itself serves as collateral for the loan. Mortgages typically have lower interest rates and lower default rates compared to other loans because they are secured by valuable assets (real estate).

### Loan Characteristics Explained

1. **Interest Rate:** The percentage of the loan amount that the borrower pays to the lender as a fee for borrowing money. For example, a 5% interest rate on a $1,000 loan means the borrower pays $50 in interest annually.

2. **Default Probability:** The likelihood that a borrower will fail to repay their loan. For example, if personal loans have a 5% default probability, this means that, historically, 5 out of 100 personal loan borrowers fail to repay.

3. **Loss Given Default (LGD):** The percentage of the loan amount that the lender loses when a borrower defaults. A 100% LGD means the lender loses the entire loan amount, while a 50% LGD means the lender recovers half of the loan amount.

4. **Expected Return:** The average return a lender can expect from a particular loan type, accounting for both successful repayments and defaults. It's calculated as: Interest Rate × (1 - Default Probability) - Default Probability × LGD.

5. **Risk (Variance or Standard Deviation):** Measures how much the actual returns might differ from the expected returns. Higher variance means more uncertainty.

6. **Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR):** A risk measure that focuses on potential losses in worst-case scenarios. For example, a 95% CVaR of 5% means that in the worst 5% of scenarios, the average loss is 5%.

7. **Correlation Between Loan Types:** The degree to which default rates of different loan types move together. High correlation means if one loan type experiences high defaults, others likely will too, which increases overall portfolio risk.

### Users of the LoanOptimizer App

1. **Bank Loan Officers:** Professionals responsible for managing a bank's loan portfolio. They use the app to determine how to distribute the bank's available funds across different loan types to maximize returns while managing risk.

2. **Credit Union Managers:** Similar to bank loan officers but working for credit unions, which are member-owned financial cooperatives.

3. **Investment Portfolio Managers:** Professionals who manage investment portfolios for clients and might include loans as part of their investment strategy.

4. **Individual Investors:** People who have capital to invest and are considering lending as an investment vehicle (e.g., through peer-to-peer lending platforms).

5. **Financial Advisors:** Professionals who provide advice to clients about investments, including loan investments.

6. **Risk Managers:** Professionals responsible for ensuring that a financial institution's risk exposure is within acceptable limits.

### What Users Will Do with the App

1. **Input Data:**
   - Enter the types of loans they offer or are considering (e.g., personal loans, auto loans, mortgages)
   - Specify the characteristics of each loan type (interest rates, default probabilities, etc.)
   - Set their total available capital (capital budget)
   - Define their risk tolerance and constraints

2. **Run Optimization:**
   - The app will calculate the optimal allocation of their capital across the different loan types
   - This means determining what percentage of their capital should go to each loan type

3. **View Results:**
   - See recommended allocation percentages (e.g., 30% to mortgages, 25% to auto loans, etc.)
   - View expected returns (how much money they're likely to make)
   - Understand the risk level of the recommended portfolio

4. **Perform Analysis:**
   - "What-if Scenarios": These are hypothetical situations users can explore. For example:
     - What if default rates increase by 20% due to an economic downturn?
     - What if interest rates decrease due to central bank policies?
     - What if regulatory requirements change, requiring more low-risk loans?
   
   - Sensitivity Analysis: Understanding how small changes in inputs affect the outcomes
     - How would a 1% increase in mortgage interest rates affect the overall portfolio return?
     - How sensitive is the portfolio to changes in default rates?

5. **Export Data:**
   - Download results for reporting or further analysis
   - Save scenarios for future comparison

**Subject To:**
- Total allocation = Capital Budget
- No negative allocations
- Diversification limits (e.g., no more than 30% in one loan type)
- Risk constraint (e.g., portfolio variance ≤ user-specified level)
- Regulatory constraints (e.g., minimum allocation to low-risk loans)
- User-defined constraints

### Technical Stack

- **Backend:** Python with Flask, pandas, NumPy, CVXPY
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript (Chart.js for visualizations)
- **Database:** SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)
- **Deployment:** Heroku cloud platform

## Detailed Sample Data and Example

### Example Use Case

**User:** Regional Bank Loan Manager
**Capital Budget:** $10 million
**Available Loan Types:**
