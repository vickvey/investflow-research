# LoanOptimizer: A Product-Based Web Application for Loan Portfolio Optimization

## Project Overview

## Title: Loan Portfolio Optimization for Risk and Return
- Product Name: LoanOptimizer

## Objective: Develop a product-based web application that enables financial institutions (e.g., banks, credit unions, peer-to-peer lending platforms) and individual users (e.g., investors, financial advisors) to optimize loan portfolio allocations, maximize expected returns, manage risk, and gain predictive and inferential insights for decision-making.

- Target Users: Firms (e.g., banks, lending platforms) and individuals (e.g., investors, loan officers) seeking to allocate capital across loan types efficiently.
- Timeline: 20 days (assumed based on prior context, adjustable as needed).
Team Size: 5 members.
- Final Deliverable: A fully functional, deployed web application accessible via a public URL, with user authentication, input flexibility, optimization, analytics, visualizations, and export features.

## Detailed Problem Statement

### Context
You are a team of fintech developers tasked with creating "LoanOptimizer," a versatile, product-based web application designed to serve a diverse user base, including financial institutions and individual users. The web app will enable users to optimize the allocation of a capital budget across a portfolio of loan types (e.g., personal loans, auto loans, mortgages, etc.) to maximize expected returns (interest income) while keeping the risk of loan defaults (measured as variance or Conditional Value-at-Risk, CVaR) within user-specified thresholds. Beyond optimization, the app will provide predictive analytics (e.g., forecasts, scenario analyses) and inferential analytics (e.g., sensitivity analyses, statistical insights) to help users anticipate future performance, assess the robustness of the solution, and make informed decisions. The final product must be a scalable, secure, and user-friendly web service deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku), featuring an intuitive interface for inputting data, running optimizations, visualizing results, and exporting reports.

### Specific Parameters

1. Loan Types:
   - Users can define a portfolio of N loan types (minimum 2, maximum 20), such as personal loans, auto loans, mortgages, small business loans, credit card loans, student loans, etc.
   - Each loan type is characterized by its risk-return profile (interest rate, default probability, loss given default, correlations).

2. Default Dataset:
   - A default dataset is provided for users without their own data:
     Loan Type          Interest Rate  Default Probability  LGD  Expected Return*
     Personal Loans     12%            5%                   100% 6.7%
     Auto Loans         8%             3%                   100% 4.9%
     Mortgages          4%             1%                   100% 3.0%
     Small Business     15%            8%                   100% 6.8%
     Credit Card Loans  18%            10%                  100% 7.2%
     *Expected Return = Interest Rate × (1 - Default Probability) - Default Probability × LGD
   - Default covariance matrix (simulated, moderate correlations):
     [[0.0025, 0.0010, 0.0005, 0.0015, 0.0020],
      [0.0010, 0.0018, 0.0003, 0.0008, 0.0012],
      [0.0005, 0.0003, 0.0009, 0.0004, 0.0006],
      [0.0015, 0.0008, 0.0004, 0.0022, 0.0018],
      [0.0020, 0.0012, 0.0006, 0.0018, 0.0030]]

3. Capital Budget:
   - Users specify their capital budget B (default: $10 million, adjustable from $100,000 to $100 million or more).

4. Expected Returns:
   - Calculated as R_i = r_i × (1 - p_i) - p_i × LGD_i, where r_i is the interest rate, p_i is the default probability, and LGD_i is the loss given default.
   - Users can input custom values or use the default dataset.

5. Risk:
   - Measured as variance or CVaR at a user-specified confidence level (default: 95%).
   - Users can input their own covariance matrix or specify correlation coefficients (low=0.3, medium=0.5, high=0.7) for the app to estimate the matrix.
   - Risk tolerance defaults to 0.002 (variance, ~4.47% standard deviation) or 5% (CVaR), adjustable by users.

6. Constraints:
   - Budget: ∑ x_i = B.
   - Non-negativity: x_i ≥ 0.
   - Diversification: x_i ≤ 0.3 × B (default, adjustable).
   - Regulatory: At least 20% to low-risk loans (e.g., mortgages, auto loans), toggleable.
   - Risk: Variance ≤ 0.002 or CVaR ≤ 5% (default, adjustable).
   - Custom: User-defined min/max allocations (e.g., min 10% to small business loans).

7. Objective:
   - Maximize expected return: w^T μ, where w = x / B, subject to constraints.

8. Web App Features:
   - User Authentication: Account creation, login, and data/settings storage.
   - Loan Data Input: Form or CSV upload, with default dataset option.
